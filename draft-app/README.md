# DraftApp

DraftBoardComponent stored the draft app, it was explained in the outer README.

ContestComponent was an early idea for a DraftKings tool for myself, the idea being to show each player, their game information, and a text box.

I would input my predicted fantasy scores for any player I was considering that week, store those in mongodb, and then run those through an optimization algorithm.

That would at least help me avoid mental errors in lineup formation, so I wasn't spending sundays looking at the results, thinking, "Well, yeah, I knew those guys would play well, but I went a different direction with lineup construction."

Anyways I did find the proper python libraries to run my knapsack problem, but I never returned to this tool.  Perhaps I'll hook it up some Saturday leading up to next season, can't be too hard.
