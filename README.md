# ff-draft-helper

I made a little web app to combine my most trusted expert tiers, stats, and projections all in one interactive place for my 2017 fantasy football drafts.  I learned some node.js and mongodb on the way.

I scraped the tier information from the blog posts of the #1 ranked expert in the industry, and extracted some key stats from beersheets such as the ratio of how many {Great}/{Good}/{Not Good} games each player had last year.  I added a bit of css, and now I have a colored, organized dashboard of players to draft.

Instead of manually searching sheets of paper across multiple different expert rankings for names to cross off, I just ctrl+f and clicked once to gray it out, showing me how healthy the tiers of each position were.

For the record I had awful luck in leagues with friends, but saw a 400% ROI at draft.com best ball leagues.  I had so much fun that year, I should really update this for next season.
